## Project Summary
In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.

## Solution
The scatterplot arbitrarily highlighted sections of the graph and didn't make clear what the overall trend was. After computing a trendline and R value, I found that there is a weak negative correlation between hospital size and readmission rates. Other factors should be analyzed before deciding to make any dramatic alterations to the current hospital landscape.
