## Project Summary

In this exercise I analyze a given dataset of human body temperatures for males and females. The mean temperature estimated is found to be significantly different from that reported by Wunderlich in 1868 (Using a 1 sample t-test with 95% CI). In addition, the difference in body temperature between males and females is also statistically significant (2 sample t-test, 95% CI).
