## Project Summary
This dataset contains information on whether a job applicant received a callback. The dataset marks whether the person had a white-sounding name or a black-sounding name. The sample size is 4870 split equally amongst black names and white names. Black names had a callback rate of 6.44%, while white-sounding names had a callback rate of 9.65%. To determine whether the difference in callback rates is statistically significant, a 2 sample $t$-test was used.
__Null Hypothesis:__ There is not a statistically significant difference in the callback rates of black and white names
__Alternate Hypothesis:__ There is a statistically significant difference in the callback rates of black and white names

## Results
The difference in callback rates was found to be statistically significant as p <.05. This means that the null hypopthesis is rejected and alternate hypothesis is accepted at the .05 significance level.
